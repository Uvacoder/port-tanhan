After some googling, I <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9240\">landed onto an issue reported to babel</a>.</p>\n<p>I think in most cases, when we ended up onto an open Github issue, there’s where all our leads ended. The only one obvious way solution is to wait, wait for the library maintainer to fix it.</p>\n<p>The next best alternative is to read through the issue threads, and find any patches or workarounds that can be applied in the mean time.</p>\n<p>We have been so used to making use of an open source libraries, tools or frameworks in our daily development, but it rarely occurred to us, that we should sometime, contribute back to the open source libraries, tools or frameworks we used.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I felt inadequate when I made my first merge request to <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel\">babel</a>. Who am I to make changes to the tool that was used by every JavaScript developer in the world?</p>\n<p>My answer to that is, <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/graphs/contributors\">everyone plays an important role</a> in shaping how babel is today. Babel, or any other library would not be what it is today, without the constant contributions from the community.</p>\n<p>So, if you are interested in playing a part in the open source libraries, tools or frameworks you used, spare me a few more minutes to read my following two cents on how you could get started in contributing to open source libraries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-read-code-classlanguage-textcontributingmdcode\"><a href=\"#1-read-code-classlanguage-textcontributingmdcode\" aria-label=\"1 read code classlanguage textcontributingmdcode permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1. Read <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code></h2>\n<p>Most popular open source libraries have this file called <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is where library maintainers document down what you should know before starting to contribute to the library.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">babel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">React</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">TypeScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">JQuery</a>…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you want to start contributing, start with reading <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-good-first-issue\"><a href=\"#2-good-first-issue\" aria-label=\"2 good first issue permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Good First Issue</h2>\n<p>Usually mentioned within <code class=\"language-text\">CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, most popular libraries do label their issues to categorize them. In our case, <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Good First Issue&quot;</code> is what starters should look out for. When library maintainers labelled their issue as <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Good First Issue&quot;</code>, they usually expect to guide and give advice to anyone who is willing to work on the issue. By working through the issue, contributors should gain some practical understanding on how things works, and be more confident in fixing the next bug.</p>\n<p>Examples of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Good First Issue&quot;</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">TypeScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">React</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-it-doesnt-have-to-be-code\"><a href=\"#3-it-doesnt-have-to-be-code\" aria-label=\"3 it doesnt have to be code permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. It doesn’t have to be code</h2>\n<p>When we think about contributing to open source, we might just think of contributing in terms of code. Well, we don’t have to limit ourselves to just contributing code. There are a lot other ways to contribute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Report an issue</strong>. Discuss and make suggestions in the issue</li>\n<li><strong>Improving the docs</strong>. You may have spent a lot of time figuring out, maybe it will save the next person’s time by converting your experience into a better doc?</li>\n<li><strong>Tweet, blog or talk</strong> about it. Good thing must share.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"closing-notes\"><a href=\"#closing-notes\" aria-label=\"closing notes permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Closing Notes</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in contributing to open source, and have no idea how to get started, these are 3 tips I can give to you.</p>\n<p>Hope to see your contributions out there soon!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/how-to-get-started-in-contributing-to-open-source/","wip":false},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to get started in contributing to open source","dateTimestamp":"2019-06-05T08:00:00UTC","date":"June 05, 2019","lastUpdatedTimestamp":null,"lastUpdated":null,"description":null,"tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/how-to-get-started-in-contributing-to-open-source/","type":"blog","noteDate":null,"noteTitle":null,"wip":false,"heroImageUrl":null,"heroTwitterImageUrl":null,"previous":{"id":"afab1a46-c38f-5481-b6ee-1a630e6e26f1","fields":{"slug":"/Debugging-web-workers/","type":"blog","noteDate":null,"noteTitle":null,"wip":false},"frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging Web Workers"}},"next":{"id":"dae39216-1c0c-5a37-8a5e-3e2e0d3215be","fields":{"slug":"/learn-in-public/","type":"blog","noteDate":null,"noteTitle":null,"wip":false},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learn in Public"}}}}}
