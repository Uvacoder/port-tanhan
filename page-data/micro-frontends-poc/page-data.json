Furthermore, they <strong>shouldn’t be</strong> bundled into the micro frontend as multiple instance of <code class=\"language-text\">react</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">react-router</code> may cause some bugs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A shared global state</strong></p>\n<p>In this demo, I am using <a href=\"https://redux.js.org\">redux</a> for state management.</p>\n<p>Each micro-frontend is connected to the same global store, so data is easily shared across the application.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Bridge</h2>\n<p>The center piece of this micro frontend architecture is <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/Bridge/index.js\">the Bridge</a>.</p>\n<p>It contains 2 types of communication method:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>message passing</li>\n<li>shared memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Message passing</strong> is done via a pub sub mechanism called <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/Bridge/Channel.js\">the Channel</a>, whereas <strong>shared memory</strong> is done via <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/Bridge/Registry.js\">the Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>I attach the Bridge to the window, so each micro frontend can connect to the bridge.</p>\n<h2>The routing mechanism</h2>\n<p>In the PoC, I used <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web\">react-router</a> as the routing library. The <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/Routes.js#L17\">route definition</a> is dynamic, as it listens <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;registerRoute&quot;</code> event through <em>the Bridge</em>, and add it to the route definition.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that, I use <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;Switch /&gt;</code>, which will render the first <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;Route /&gt;</code> that matches the url.</p>\n<p>The magic happens in the last route, which will be rendered when none of the routes in the route definition matches.</p>\n<p>The last route renders the <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/FallbackDiscovery.js\">Fallback Discovery</a> component, which will based on the current location and some pre-defined rules, tries to find the micro frontend manifest for the unknown route. </p>\n<p>If the micro frontend manifest does not exist, it will render a 404 page. However, if the manifest exists, it will fetch the manifest file.</p>\n<p>The micro frontend manifest file is nothing but a json file that contains the <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/FallbackDiscovery.js#L31\">entry asset</a> for the route micro frontend.</p>\n<p>Once the entry asset is loaded, the new micro frontend itself will register a new route to the route definition via <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;registerRoute&quot;</code> event, which has to be the route that matches the current URL.</p>\n<p>Whenever there’s a new route added, the <code class=\"language-text\">react-router</code>’s <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;Router /&gt;</code> component will re-render and it will match the newly added route, which renders our newly added micro-frontend.</p>\n<h2>The global registry</h2>\n<p>There’s 2 main reasons why I am not bundling <code class=\"language-text\">react</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">react-redux</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">react-router</code> into each micro frontends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bundle size</strong>, there’s no reason to download duplicate copies of <code class=\"language-text\">react</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">react-redux</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No multiple instance</strong>, both <code class=\"language-text\">react-redux</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">react-router</code> uses React Context to pass information down the React component tree. However, this way of data passing disallow multiple instances of the <em>Context</em> object, as each instances has a different memory reference.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the main SPA runtime bundles <code class=\"language-text\">react</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">react-redux</code>, etc and <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/initRegistry.js#L9\">set it into the <code class=\"language-text\">Bridge.Registry</code>.</a>.</p>\n<p>When each micro-frontend is built, the <em>import statement</em> for these modules <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/food/webpack.config.js#L23\">will be transformed</a> into the <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/build/BridgeAliasPlugin/aliases/react.js\">some aliases</a>, that reads the module from the <code class=\"language-text\">Bridge.Registry</code>.</p>\n<h2>Shared Global State</h2>\n<p>In the PoC, the micro frontends are <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/food/src/FoodDetail.js#L36\">connected to the shared global store via <code class=\"language-text\">connect()</code> from <code class=\"language-text\">react-redux</code></a></p>\n<p>Interesting to note is that both <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/food/src/FoodDetail.js#L13\">the food detail</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/foods/src/FoodList.js\">the food list</a> register the same key for the reducer, but yet both of the works seamlessly.</p>\n<p>Note that when we transit from Food List page to Food Detail page, we already have the food detail information from the store, therefore there is no need to fetch the food detail anymore.</p>\n<h1>Trying it out locally</h1>\n<p>Run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn start</code> in the root folder, which will <a href=\"https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/scripts/start-dev-server.js\">start a simple express server</a>. The express server is used to serve static files based on specific rules.</p>\n<p>To build individual micro frontends, you need to go to each folder and run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn build</code>. Alternatively, you can start the watch mode via <code class=\"language-text\">yarn dev</code>.</p>\n<h2>Developing the micro frontend individually</h2>\n<p>WIP</p>","fields":{"wip":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yet Another Micro Frontend Proof of Concept","date":"July 15, 2019","lastUpdated":null,"description":"A decentralised router definition"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/micro-frontends-poc/","type":"blog","noteDate":null,"noteTitle":null,"wip":true,"previous":null,"next":null}}}
