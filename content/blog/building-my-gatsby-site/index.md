After reading Dan's [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io) & Wei's [A Work in Progress](https://dev.wgao19.cc/) a while ago, I decided to have my [own blog](https://lihautan.com/blogs) as well! _(In case you still don't know, it's the very one you are reading right now!)_

I took it as an opportunity to learn [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), I've heard about it for a while, so I guess it's to know how it works.

This article is **NOT about how to build a Gatsby site**, there a lot resources about that you can go for. But I am here to share some of my customisations that I've added to my Gatsby site, and hopefully you would share yours too.

## The boilerplate

I used the exact same Gatsby starter pack as Dan's [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io), because why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It looks sleek and simple and I like it.
