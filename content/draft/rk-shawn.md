1. Introduce yourself.
1. Why makes you decide to write the book?
1. Could you share with us, for the benefit of those who haven't read your book, the structure of the book, and the user will get out from the book.
1. You give really good advice in the book for junior developers and transitioning from junior to senior developers, can you tell us a bit more on those ideas

I see you structure your book into principles and strategies, principles are actionable steps / mental model you adopt, and strategies, is something, in your own words, "you apply anytime when you make major irreversible decisions, in the face of uncertainty."

this reminds me of Jeff Bezos comparison of decision making to doors. 

Reversible decisions are doors open both ways, and Irreversible decisions are doors that only allow passage in one direction. if you walk through, you are stuck there. 

Decisions that are irreversible, or nearly irreversible, should be made methodicaly, carefuly and slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. which he call it **Type 1 decision**.

But most decisions aren't like that, they are changeable, reversible. if you make suboptimal **Type 2 decision**, you dont have to live with the consequences for that long, you can reopen the door and go back through. 

Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly.

## So, based on your understading, what are type 1 irreversible decisions or type 2 reverssible decisions in a coding career?

1. The last time when you were here, talking about "learn in public", some of us find it hard to sustain, and find learning in public a bit lonely and demoralising. It seemed that you've provided a hack for learning in public, which is "pick up what they put down". Can you share a bit more about it?

1. we all know about open sourcing our codebase, where community contributing, improving and maintaining a project, and you said **"what happened to code is now happening to knowledge"**. A good example of open source knowledge is **wikipedia**, and you mentioned a personal anecdote where you created a **react typescript cheatsheet**, 

## im not sure i understand open sourcing knowledge correctly, correct me if im wrong, but what's your take on open sourcing our knowledge, why do you think its important?



1. In RK, we often share a lot of new technologies, interesting new tools / libraries. Things change fast, especially in the frontend world, and we are often flooded with new things. Do you have any advice or any strategry we should employ for us on how to navigate through this?
