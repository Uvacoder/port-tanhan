# 08 ðŸ”§ You can create good luck for yourself, just remember it still takes effort.

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

Love the quote? My friend [@tzyinc](https://twitter.com/tzyinc) has been [posting wisdom daily on his twitter](https://twitter.com/tzyinc/status/1313721681261719553). This tweet reminds me of the [Luck Surface Area](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area), [creating luck](https://careerchats.transistor.fm/episodes/season-1-episode-2-luck) and [4 kinds of luck](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html).

## Working on Svelte Summit talk

Over the past 2 weeks, I've been working on my talk for Svelte Summit, it's done and [see you peeps this Sunday](https://sveltesummit.com/)!

While working on my talk, I created [this REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/51e813279e2247809426f40d88faf84e?version=3.29.0) to help visualise and explain how transition works.

I used `<svg>` and `<polyline>` to draw the graph, [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) for the syntax highlighting.

## Building a webpack clone workshop

As mentioned in the previous newsletter, I started hosting a workshop on implementing a webpack clone within [my company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopee/). It's going to be 8-week long. We meet up 1 hour per week, discuss on 1 concept about webpack, and spend the rest of the week implementing the concept out.

The 1st week's concept and assignment is out. It's about resolving. You can [check them out here](https://lihautan.com/building-a-simplified-webpack-clone).

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
