# 02 ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You are limited only by yourself

Hey friends!

Hope y'all are doing well this week. I guess you've learned something over the week, and be a better you week by week!

It's time for a weekly reflection, and prepare ourselves for the coming week.

## My Learnings from Conference Talks

### React Rally

Did you catch the [React Rally in Cyberspace](https://www.reactrally.com/) this Friday?

The topics are pretty rad.

Too bad I missed it, would have to wait for the videos to come out then.

### LeadDev

[LeadDev Live Summer 2020](https://live.leaddev.com/) happened this Wednesday.

I've never see myself as a good leader or mentor. I think I am okay with breaking down and explaining technical concepts, but I am not good at guiding and mentoring at a longer term.

In the first few years of my career, this hasn't been a problem to me. I've been honing my technical skills, and learning to write better code and designing better architecture. All along, I am very much an independent individual contributor.

But as I started to have more scope and influence, I start to see the need on improving on my leadership skills.

That's why I spent time this week to wath the past recordings of LeadDev. Here is my notes on [LeadDev New York 2019](https://lihautan.com/notes/lead-dev/), I am still half-way through, and I'll update them as I go.

And if you are like me, learning on management or leadership skills, I recommend checking out [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan).

## My Learnings from Podcast

### CSS Functions

As always, I learned a lot from CSS Podcast this week.

I've summarised my learnings on CSS Functions into a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1294528682468360193?s=20) and [note](https://lihautan.com/notes/css-podcast-020-functions/).

What most suprised me is all the different vulnerabilities that CSS can bring, read [Jake Archibald's Third Party CSS is not safe](https://jakearchibald.com/2018/third-party-css-is-not-safe/).

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! üëã
