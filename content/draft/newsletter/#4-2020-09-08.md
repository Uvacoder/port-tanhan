# 04 ðŸ“š An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. - Benjamin Franklin

Hey friends!

How are y'all doing for the past 2 weeks?

It's been 2 weeks, and I had been busy working on [my talk for CityJS](https://cityjsconf.org/speaker/5ef7691c6531335bed0002e0).

Finally it's done! But I missed out sending the this supposedly **weekly** learning newsletter.

Now I realised how hard it is to consistently sending out content every week without a miss.

So even though I don't have much content for this week, and am probably sending them out late, I still send it anyways!

Consistency is more important ðŸ’ª!

## Year 2020 resolution

We are approaching the [final 30% of 2020](https://twitter.com/year_progress), its time to review our year 2020 resolution.

My 2020 resolution this year is to speak at a conference, well, although the in-person conference got cancelled because of the COVID, I got to do online conference. I will be speaking at [CityJS Conference Online Event](https://cityjsconf.org/home) next week. (it's pre-recorded so I'll be watching my talk with the audience).

An online conference instead of the in-person conference, not too bad for 2020. ðŸ˜‚

> _Also, shout out to [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) for his  [comprehensive guide on prerecording talks for conferences](https://dev.to/swyx/tips-for-speakers-prerecording-talks-for-online-conferences-4ic9)_


My next goal will be to build my personal branding, the first milestone will be getting 10K followers on twitter by the end of the year! (follow me [@lihautan](https://twitter.com/lihautan) if you haven't ðŸ˜‚) 

So, reply me with your year 2020 resolution, and we shall hold each other accountable towards our goal for the year.

## My Learnings from NewsLetter

### Frontend Horse

If you've read my previous issues, you know I love Frontend Horse.

Frontend Horse not only curates great Codepen, the newsletter breaks down the techniques behind each pen. What's more, there's a Q&A section with the codepen creator.

[This week's Frontend Horse](https://frontend.horse/issues/14/) explains how to create this [Supa Dupa Fly](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/LYNNYyQ) animation. It's about clip-path, building svg polygon paths with [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) and animate them, how to have fun with animation playing `animation-timing-function` and `animation-delay`.

## My Learnings from Podcast

### CSS Filters

As usual, my favourite podcast for CSS.

This weeks podcast is about CSS Filters. 

Also, I was [discussing with Adam about the differences between grayscale and desaturate in CSS](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1303138952304422912?s=20), join the conversation if you know more their differences.

So, I've summarised my learnings into a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1303154750406275072). Enjoy.

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
