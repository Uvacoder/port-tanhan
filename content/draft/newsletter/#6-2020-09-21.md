# 06 ðŸŽ¬ The secret of getting ahead is getting started â€“ Mark Twain

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

This week started with CityJS Conf, it's my first time attending a virtual conference! As the conference happened at BST (British Summer Time, GMT+1), which is 7 hours behind Singapore Time (GMT+8), I had some hard time staying awake through the whole conference. And it felt confusing to stay awake at a different timezone with my roommate.

Anyway, attending the conference is definitely an eye-opening experience to me. I get to e-meet and speak with other speakers and the audience.

All of the talks are amazing, but here are some of my personal favourites.

_(Well, I like them because they are something I'm actively trying to learn. So there's definitely a bias here.)_

### CityJS Conf 2020 Online Event

1. Module Federation - Zack Jackson

[Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) is one of awaiting features for the upcoming webpack 5. Some of the weback runtime and dependency management got rewritten in order to support module federation.

I talked to Zack after the talk, and he shared with me his curated YouTube playlist of video resources on Module Federation: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWSiF9YHHK-DqsFHGYbeAMwbd9xcZbEWJ

2. Accessible.JS - Jemima Abu

I noted some of my learnings in a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1305938555651325952?s=20). Of course if you haven't using Twitter yet, start now! ðŸ˜‰

3. Node.js scalability tips - Luciano Mammino

Scalability in NodeJS is very much different from scalability with NodeJS application. Check out [Luciano's slide](https://slides.com/lucianomammino/node-js-scalability-tips-city-js) where he shared 5 tips on scalability.

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
