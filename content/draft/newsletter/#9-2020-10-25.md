# 09 ðŸ¤” Everything can be fixed. Calm down first and then think

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

Love the quote? My friend [@tzyinc](https://twitter.com/tzyinc) has been [posting wisdom daily on his twitter](https://twitter.com/tzyinc/status/1319157674219483137).

This tweet itself could be interpreted in multitude of ways, my personal take is this: the most important thing is not about the fix, its about **what we've learned about the problem**, and **where we want to be next**.

If the problem itself is a programming error, coding error _(what)_, is there a way we can improve ourselves _(where)_ to avoid this problem in the future?

If the problem is a common mistake due to bad tooling _(what)_, is there a way we can build a better tooling _(where)_ to avoid it in the future?

## Svelte Summit 2020

Last Sunday was Svelte Summit, and I planned to summarise all the talks and share with y'all in this newsletter. _It's taking more effort that I imagined to rewatch all the talks and noting down all the key points in the talk._

Well, [Achim Vedam](https://twitter.com/vedamart) summarised all the talks [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/vedam/cb1fca38d021143a87f59813f36995dc), so I can do it too!

For those who have been [following me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lihautan), I've been [posting summary on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1318111506089701378?s=20) talk by talk. 

For thos who don't frequent Twitter, I've [written them in my blog too](https://lihautan.com/notes/svelte-summit-2020-summary).

Which brings me to the next thing I would like to share...

## My YouTube Channel

I've realised that not everyone is on Twitter, just as not everyone's preferred learning mode is to read articles.

And probably you may have noticed, whenever I share a link in this newsletter, I've tried to share a Twitter thread and a link to my blog site.

_(Well, for now most of my Twitter thread converted articles are still "tweet"-alike, except the code snippets is actual text instead of image)._

Since the I've done my research into the subject before writing it out as a Tweet / blog, I decided to extend it into a video form as well.

So, welcome ** drumroll... ** to [my new YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmC3HP3FaAFdcZkui8YoMQ)!

I'll curate all my past talks, as well going to video-ify (if there's such a word) my previous articles, and of course create new video content in it too!

YouTube, Twitter, and blog; each of them has it's own edge in terms of delivering content. And probably you may notice my content, whether they are blog-first, tweet-first or video-first approach.

_Anyway, enough of my rant._

Please do [subscribe my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmC3HP3FaAFdcZkui8YoMQ?sub_confirmation=1), I'll create more content in it!

## Building a webpack clone workshop

For those who have followed me in my previous newsletter, week 2 for the building a webpack clone workshop is out! It's about bundling, and both the key concepts and assignments is out, and you can [check them out here](https://lihautan.com/building-a-simplified-webpack-clone/#week-bundling)!

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
