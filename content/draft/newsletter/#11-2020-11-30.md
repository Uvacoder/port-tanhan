# 11 🏃‍♂️ Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

So, here are some of the things I've done over the past weeks

## Mastering Svelte Transitions

I've adding more content to my [Svelte Transition playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U):
- [Introduction to Svelte Transition #2 - Coordinating Transitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTctuCkUT9c&list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U&index=2)
- [Introduction to Svelte Transition #3 - Transition Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-LroTSC54E&list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U&index=3)
- [Custom Svelte Transitions - Flipboard transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Kk-axA_mA&list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U&index=6&t=1s)

I have outlined more videos into this playlist, covering knowledge you need to know about transitions, creating custom transitions and how transitions work under the hood, as well as application of the knowledge with more "real-world" examples.

So, it's a matter of time of producing and uploading them.

CSS Houdini is a umbrella term that covers a set of low-level APIs that allow us, as developers, to tap into the CSS rendering engine.

[Una and Adam will be sharing more of CSS Houdini](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/) in the coming [Chrome Dev Summit 2020](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/). This year's CDS will be a virtual conference, so mark your calendar for December 09-10.

## Svelte Indonesia Meetup

Last Friday, I gave a talk at Svelte Indonesia Meetup [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSeVAQeKSak)].

It's the same talk that I've given a few times, looking into the Svelte compiler, but this time round, I gave the talk in Malay (+ a little bit of Indonesian).

> For those who don't know about the Malay language, and Indonesian language, the former is the official language in Malaysia (which I grew up in) and the latter Indonesia.
> 
> Both of the languages belongs to the [same language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language). Native speakers coming from either group can understand each other, except they will sound funny to the other person, because of intonation and word choice.
> 
> Imagine speaking to Shakespeare, you probably can understand all the words he speak, but you wouldn't express the same idea with the same word. 😅

I knew there's difference between Malay and Indonesian, so I google translated my original English script into both Malay and Indonesian, rephrased the Malay translation to make it sound normal, and cross examined and borrowed the vocab from the Indonesian translation to make it sound more native Indonesian.

Overall, it's a pretty interesting experience to me. Growing up in Malaysia, I've never given a talk in Malay. My knowledge in the language stays in school (my history and geography lessons are taught in Malay) and ordering food (most of the time is point and pick, and understand how much I need to pay). Nonetheless, it was fun. 😂

After having fun giving a talk in Malay, I guess my next goal would be giving it in Chinese (my mother tongue) in a meetup in China? 🤔

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! 👋
