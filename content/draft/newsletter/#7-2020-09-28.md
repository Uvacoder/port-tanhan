# 07 üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When you're near your limit, focus on moving one foot forward at a time.

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

Love the quote? My friend [@tzyinc](https://twitter.com/tzyinc) has been [posting wisdom daily on his twitter](https://twitter.com/tzyinc/status/1309735626086862851). I particularly like this one.

So, for the past week, I've been on to a [YouTube live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuIwyD9ftY) with [Eddie Jaoude](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude), converting a static HTML into a Svelte application. I met Eddie at CityJS Conf, it's always nice to meet new people at a conference. Eddie is running a [community of new developers at Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jZQs6Wu), they've been very active in the chat, and proactively learning new frameworks and libraries.

**Here's some tl;dr we did on the livestream:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ we learned basic svelte syntax on the [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl)

2Ô∏è‚É£ we copied the entire HTML in the `<body>` into the REPL, and start refactoring within the REPL.

3Ô∏è‚É£ the download button on the top-right corner allows you to download the Svelte boilerplate + the files you've written in the REPL

Also, I went on to [talk.js](https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js/issues/41), a SingaporeJS meetup, to talk about "Compile Svelte in your head" ([video](https://engineers.sg/video/compile-svelte-in-your-head-singaporejs--4120));

And [MMT Tech Meetup](https://www.linkedin.com/events/6709193245668196352/) to talk about the "Svelte compiler", (well, the same talk I given at the CityJS Conf). ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT1altUaaJU)).

The MMT Tech Meetup happened at 6pm BST, which is 1am in Singapore üò¥. I think you could tell how late it was and how tired I was in the YouTube video.

Also, I managed to push 2 blog post over the past week.

**1. [Part 4 of the Compile Svelte in your Head](https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-4/)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ how to implement if-else template in vanilla JS

2Ô∏è‚É£ how that translates into Svelte's compiled JS output

3Ô∏è‚É£ what is the `anchor_node`?

**2.  [Contributing to Svelte: Implement {#key} block](https://lihautan.com/contributing-to-svelte-implement-key-block/)**

This article complements well if you've [watched my talk in CityJS Conf](https://lihautan.com/looking-into-the-svelte-compiler). The talk walks through step-by-step how the Svelte compiler works, and this article shows how we implement each step for a `{#key}` block.

Hopefully this gives you a fuller picture of the Svelte compiler. Of course, as always, [reach out to me on twitter](https://twitter.com/lihautan) if you have anything unclear with either content.

## What's next?

I'll start working on my next Svelte talk, it will be about transitions in Svelte. üòè

At the same time, I'm hosting a workshop on implementing a webpack clone within the company. Hopefully some of those content will be out for you guys :)

I've been more freestyle lately with the newsletter content, hopefully you guys are okay with it. Well, reply this email with your feedback. I'll read all your emails üòÅ

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! üëã
