# 10 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Consistent effort is better than one big effort and never again

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

Love the quote? My friend [@tzyinc](https://twitter.com/tzyinc) has been [posting wisdom daily on his twitter](https://twitter.com/tzyinc/status/1325317377869799425).

**Consistency is hard**. My weekly newsletter has somehow slowly, procrastinate-ly becoming a bi-weekly newsletter. Weekends slip by and we're now at the last 2 months of 2020. üò± 

Nonetheless, here are some of the things I've done over the past weeks

## My YouTube channel

Once again, here's my [new YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmC3HP3FaAFdcZkui8YoMQ)!

I've been having fun creating some content in it, here are some of them:

## Building a webpack clone workshop

For those who have followed me in my previous newsletter, I've been sharing my [webpack clone workshop progress over here](https://lihautan.com/building-a-simplified-webpack-clone/). We've been through lazy loading, loaders, and optimisation. But I haven't got time to update the notes yet. üòÖ Well, stay tune, will update y'all once it's updated!
