Hey friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

This week it's going to be a short one. Not every week is a productive week. üòÖ 

### SVG Filters

Last week, I shared about [CSS Filters from CSS Podcast](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1303154750406275072). Besides those built-in CSS filters, you can use SVG filters in CSS too. which brought me to a rabbit hole of learning about SVG filters.

[Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) wrote amazing intro articles to SVG filters, which is a great entry point to look into the world of SVG filters. I have a [twitter thread summarising the "SVG Filters 101"](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1304721501451501569?s=20).

Also, a relatively new monthly newsletter about SVG, [viewBox](https://viewbox.club/)'s 2nd issue is about [SVG Filters](https://buttondown.email/viewBox/archive/3d0142a4-114e-4b54-9c35-97c2640688d0). They've curated some codepens using SVG filters, which are very cool, especially the one that [creates a water droplet using SVG filter](https://codepen.io/raczo/pen/KKVbQmV). Following the issue, there's a monthly [#viewBoxChallenge](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23viewBoxChallenge), which [the submission for the month of SVG filters](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23viewBoxChallenge%20filters&src=typed_query) is a great source of learning too!

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! üëã
