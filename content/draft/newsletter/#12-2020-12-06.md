# 12 ðŸ¤© All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them

Hi friends,

It's been another week, how are y'all doing?

So, here are some of the things I've done over the past weeks

## Mastering Svelte Transitions

I've added 2 more videos to my [Svelte Transition playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U):
- [Introduction to Svelte Transition #4 - Easing Transitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQc9mwBGJ5Q&list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U&index=4)
- [Accessible Svelte Transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK_QuRL7nSo&list=PLoKaNN3BjQX20O5A1V5SUJ5kZWkfJX71U&index=5)

## 1 Svelte concept 1 month on Twitter

I've decided to share 1 Svelte concept a month, posting 1 tidbits around the concept everyday, as a motivation for myself to tweet daily.

So the concept of the month is **Svelte Transition**.

Well, it's something that I've been posting quite regularly recently, and I am confident to posting it daily for a month.

So here's [my Twitter thread for the month](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1333803774146592775).

## The Undefined Podcast - Vue vs. Svelte with Evan You and Rich Harris

How often do you get to listen a 1+ hour podcast with Evan You and Rich Harris discussing about web frameworks?

[This episode is a must listen](https://undefined.fm/radio/vue-vs-svelte-with-evan-you-and-rich-harris)!

Some interesting questions in the episode:

- The year is 2025, what does Svelte look like? what does Vue look like?
- Are you optimising for developer productivity versus end user experience, and how do you balance these 2 things?
- Have either of you try writing Svelte or Vue in a different language (other than JavaScript)?

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
