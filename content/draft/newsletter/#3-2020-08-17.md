# 03 ðŸ‘€ You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards

Hey friends!

How are y'all doing this week? 

For myself, I'm mostly preparing for my talk at [CityJS Conference Online Event](https://cityjsconf.org/home). I have [10 free tickets](https://ti.to/cityjsconf-london/cityjs-2020/with/community-singapore-free-online) to share with y'all, first come first serve only.

Alright, it's time for a weekly reflection!

## My Learnings from NewsLetter

### A celebration of Mozilla

The [WebAssembly Weekly Issue #126](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-126/) has dedicated the issue to Mozilla, celebrating the work the amazing team from Mozilla have done.

This includes [asm.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js), [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Pyodide](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/) and many more.

You can read more in from [WebAssembly Weekly](https://wasmweekly.news/issue-126/) and also [Matthew MacDonald](https://twitter.com/prosetech)'s [Mozilla: The Greatest Tech Company Left Behind](https://medium.com/young-coder/mozilla-the-greatest-tech-company-left-behind-9e912098a0e1)

### Frontend Horse

Frontend Horse not only curates great Codepen, the newsletter breaks down the techniques behind each pen. What's more, there's a Q&A section with the codepen creator.

Check out [this week's issue](https://frontend.horse/issues/13/) to learn animation techniques from [Pete Barr](https://twitter.com/petebarr), and how he [recreated the Swissted series with animations](https://codepen.io/collection/nNwWrk).

### Find 6 Differences in React 16 and React 17

Last week, React released v17's first release candidate, and there's already [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImRnLVuVUno), and [medium articles](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-6-major-changes-in-react-v17-0-d14fed5b0529) that summarises the changes and what to look out for. 

These contents are curated from [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/202) if you are curious where do I find them.

I personally prefer reading such announcements directly from the primary source, which is the [React website](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html). Because besides the curation of changes from the blog, they usually attached the [CHANGELOG](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html#changelog) along with the announcement.

I know it's daunting to read through the changelog, because 99% of the time, I have no idea what's happening in the React codebase.

In rare cases, you may find things that is comprehensible, such as the 2 that I listed [in my Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1297015125933559808), **better error component stack** and a **new jsx transform**.

And there are more interesting commits that is definitely worth investigating, such as [Improve memory usage](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/18970) and [Fix state leaking when a function component throws](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19212) which I didnt cover it on Twitter, because I still can't wrap my head around what are the scenarios these changes are fixing. But nonetheless, it's fun to probe and hopefully learn tips or techniques used in the React codebase, that you "almost never" in your life would use it in your code for the product you are building.

But hey! You never know. You can only connect the dots looking backwards.

## My Learnings from Podcast

### CSS Gradients

As always, I learned a lot from CSS Podcast this week.

This weeks podcast is about CSS Gradients. Finally I managed to actually learn the gradient syntax. (It has always been a copy + paste black magic to me ðŸ™ˆ)

So, I've summarised my learnings into a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1297440201334128640) and [note](https://lihautan.com/notes/css-podcast-021-gradients/). Enjoy.

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! ðŸ‘‹
