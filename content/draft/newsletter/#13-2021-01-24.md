# 13 ü¶Å It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life. - Elizabeth Kenny

Hi friends,

It's been a while since I last sent out my (supposedly weekly) newsletter. How have y'all been doing?

So, here are some of the things I've done over the past weeks

## [Svelte Actions YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoKaNN3BjQX3Gl14MBygFf8buPIw9pAeK)

I've created a list of bite-sized tutorials on Svelte actions, here are some highlights:
- [What is Svelte Actions](https://youtu.be/ciaMT_MswzE)
- [How Svelte Actions react to parameter change](https://youtu.be/5tyaUOfOFpw)
- [Integrating UI Library into a Svelte app using Svelte Actions](https://youtu.be/Y5IiSdcqdeQ)
- [Reusing event listeners with Svelte Actions](https://youtu.be/_IGEl4t1TSM)
- [Creating events with Svelte Actions](https://youtu.be/22aIzPaI3Vg)
- [The order of Svelte Actions](https://youtu.be/3R3PMEesQnM)

and here are some examples of Svelte Actions: [use:tooltip](https://youtu.be/0GqIoo66i0g), [use:viewport](https://youtu.be/1SKKzdHVvcI), [use:popper](https://youtu.be/CFj4X0bGOvE), [use:clickOutside](https://youtu.be/AzE9-6QcwmM); each of the examples demonstrates a different technique that you can pair with Svelte Actions.

## Speaking at virtualtalk.js for SingaporeJS

I've been creating video content about Svelte Actions, why not also give them out as a talk? That's exactly what [I've done for the virtualtalk.js January meetup](https://youtu.be/_h77j1BbY-k?t=2312) üòÅ

## [How to implement a tooltip positioning engine](https://youtu.be/tBn0lVUzUbA)

Someone [suggested me on Twitter to do a tutorial on _"One of those self aware tooltips that change direction based on relative position to screen"_](https://twitter.com/heydrhisham/status/1350429652574117888), I've researched into the topic and [here is my tutorial](https://youtu.be/tBn0lVUzUbA)!

It involved `getBoundingClientRect` to get the size and position of an element relative to viewport, `getComputedStyle` to figure out all the scrollable parent, and some maths.

## [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lihautan)

Occasionally, I've been asked about my paypal / patreon account, where to support me or buy me a coffee. So, here's my [Buy Me a Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lihautan) where you can join my membership, which you could get an inside peek into what I am planning, how I create my content, and also huge discounts on any content I'm selling online. Besides, you could also propose what I should do next!

If you are not sure about joining my membership, you could still buy me a coffee. Any support meant a lot to me. üòç

## Video Course: Manipulating AST with JavaScript using Babel

I've decided to share my experience on [AST and Babel in a video course](https://gum.co/manipulating-ast-with-javascript), which involves how to use prototyping a babel plugin using ASTExplorer, handling scope and setting up a Babel based codemod.

Of course, if you join my membership, you got a huge discount for my course!

## Interesting things on the Internet

Here are some of the things I've found interesting

- **[JerryScript](https://jerryscript.net/)**, a lightweight JavaScript engine that is intended to run on a very constrained devices that has limited RAM (<64 KB RAM). I'm always fascinated by JS engines and figured whether to implement one in the future for fun.
- **[2020 JavaScript Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2020/en)**, a curated list of JS toolings, libraries, and frameworks ordered based on GitHub stars. Giving you a sense of what is trending in GitHub right now.
- **[Creating comic book speech bubbles with SVG and javascript](https://humaan.com/blog/creating-comic-book-speech-bubbles-with-svg-and-javascript/?ref=sidebar)**, step-by-step tutorial on using SVG to draw a speech bubble
- **[Building a hexagonal grid using CSS grid](https://ninjarockstar.dev/css-hex-grids/)**, a tutorial showing how to use CSS grid + SASS to create a hexagonal tiles
- **[StackOverflow: Can a computer analyze audio quicker than real time playback?](https://superuser.com/questions/1612503/can-a-computer-analyze-audio-quicker-than-real-time-playback)**

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.

Until next time, friends! üëã
