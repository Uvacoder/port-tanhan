# First Issue

Hey friends!

First of all, I just wanted to give you a quick thanks for signing up for this. Most of us do not know each other in real life, yet you trust me enough to allow me to send this newsletter into your inbox.Thank you!

Now, because this is my first note out to everyone, I'm gonna try a format and if it's good, we'll stick with it. If you hate it, that's okay. Feel free to reply back and let me know what you'd like to change. This is our newsletter. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸ˜€
