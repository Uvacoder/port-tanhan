# 01 ðŸ’» Technology is just a tool, and it's a very important one.

Hey friends!

First of all, I just wanted to give you a quick thanks for signing up for this. Most of us do not know each other in real life, yet you trust me enough to allow me to send this newsletter into your inbox.Thank you!

Now, because this is my first note out to everyone, I'm gonna try a format and if it's good, we'll stick with it. If you hate it, that's okay. Feel free to reply back and let me know what you'd like to change. This is our newsletter. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸ˜€

## My Learnings from Work

There's a ton of articles our talks out there talking about switching React to Preact for better performance and bundle size. 

So, in work, we tried to substitute React with Preact to optimise the bundle size.

It works mostly, except we missed out the fine print for Suspense

> "This feature is experimental and may contain bugs. We have included it as an early preview to increase testing visibility. We don't recommend using it in production."

And we got bit by it badly, see [preact#2663](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2663), [preact#2660](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2660), [preact#2659](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2659). I believe there's more to uncover. ðŸ™ˆ

Instead of waiting for the maintainers to fix, _(it's a known issue, there's some test cases describing some of the issue get disabled)_, I decided may I could try and crack it.

Long story short, I managed to [fix some of them](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/pull/2661).

While working on the Preact codebase for my bug, I learned some interesting techniques on property mangling, which you can read about them here: ["Reduce minified code size by property mangling"](https://lihautan.com/reduce-minified-code-size-by-property-mangling/).

## My Learnings from Podcast

I listened to podcast during my commute to work, some of my regular podcasts are:

- React Podcast http://reactpodcast.com/
- Modern Web https://modernweb.podbean.com/
- JS Party https://changelog.com/jsparty
- The CSS Podcast https://thecsspodcast.libsyn.com/

If you listen to podcasts too, let me know what you are listening ðŸ˜€

### Building a second brain

The guest [this week](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/104) in React Podcast is [Jani EvÃ¤kallio](https://twitter.com/jevakallio). If you dont know who he is, he had a trippy amazing talk in React Native EU 2018, ["This is a Talk About You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVcMAtaAwsA).

In the podcast, he mentioned about the concept of [Building a second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), which is about outsourcing the memory and knowledge management from your brain to the "second brain", the technologies and tools we have around us.

With that, Jani talked about [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), which is a personal knowledge management and sharing system, that is built on top of VS Code + Github.

Following that, it lead me to [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), a workflow of learning and producing knowledge.

As you can see, there's a lot more to explore from this rabbit hole, and I am still exploring.

### z-index

As always, I learned a lot from CSS Podcast this week.

This week is about z-index.

I've summarised them into a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lihautan/status/1292136659580936193?s=20) and [note](https://lihautan.com/notes/css-podcast-019-z-index/).

And that's the end of this week! Hope you enjoyed.
