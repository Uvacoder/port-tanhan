:focus
:focus-within
:focus-visible

:focus-visible
- responsibly removal of the focus ring
- In Chrome, <button> when click it is on focus, but no focus ring
  - but when you add any css style to the button, clicking it will have focus ring
- focus:visible allow ppl to remove that instead of doing `outline:none` to all focus

:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
