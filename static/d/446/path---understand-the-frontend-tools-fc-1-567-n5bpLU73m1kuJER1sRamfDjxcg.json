I am writing this to share, and hopefully get your feedback, on how to make sense with all the frontend development tools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And there’s a lot of articles out there for beginners to pick up JavaScript and CSS, and so I am not covering that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will be assuming you have a basic understanding on how JavaScript and CSS works in building a web application.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, the opinions and insights I gathered are from articles, tweets, Github issues, and source code of the libraries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So some opinions I have might not be the true intention of the library maintainers, but I am giving my perspective in the way I think is the best for me and for you to understand the tools.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Understand the frontend tools","date":"March 16, 2019","description":"About the tools frontend developer used in 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/understand-the-frontend-tools/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/codemod-with-babel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Codemod with babel"}},"next":null}}
