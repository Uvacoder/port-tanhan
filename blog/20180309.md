# Writing your own module bundler

## Background

In [Shopee Frontend team](http://career.seagroup.com/sg/job/181/), we have a weekly tech sharing among our engineers. We take turns to share about new cool frameworks and toolings as well as how web technology works under the hood.

Recently one of my colleague shared about the current state of module bundlers and beyond. Beside [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), we have [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup), [fuse-box](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box), [brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch), and [parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) as the cool kid on the block. It made me realise that we have more and more tools to help us bundle our JavaScript code base, and at the same time we started to take these tools for granted.

So, I have this idea of building my own module bundler and I would like to share with you all the steps that I've taken and things I've learned. I hope it helps you to understand and appreciate more about our module bundlers.

## Get Started

What does a module bundler do? After studying through the source code of webpack, I summarize it as:

1. Bundle your code

   This usually can be broken up to 3 phases, the resolving, transforming, and bundling.

2. Provide development tools

   - Dev Server
   - Hot Reloading
